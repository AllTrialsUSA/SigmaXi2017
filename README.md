[AllTrials USA](http://www.senseaboutscienceusa.org/alltrials/) aims to have every clinical trial - past, present and future - registered with[ clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) and summary data reported. According to a meta-analysis by the UK government, only about half of clinical trials run globally have ever been registered, let alone outcomes reported. This finding was confirmed by NEJM's[ Anderson et al., 2015](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1409364), where Dr. Robert Califf, our FDA commissioner, reported that only 13% of clinical trials comply with the FDAAA 2007. 

Below you will find descriptions of our two free workshops that we hope to bring to Columbia University. If you have different needs for clinical trial information than are covered below, get in touch and let us know!

Workshop #1

Title: Battle bias & build trust: How to increase transparency in clinical research

Length: 30-45 minutes, 45-60 minutes with Q&A

Overview: Only about half of clinical trials run globally have ever been registered, let alone outcomes reported. This finding was confirmed by NEJM's Anderson et al., 2015, where Dr. Robert Califf, our FDA commissioner, reported that only 13% of clinical trials comply with the FDAAA 2007. This causes bias in the medical literature, which undermines both medicine and research. When the[ media reports on this lack of transparency](https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/13/clinical-trials-investigation/) in medical research, we risk[ losing the trust](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/living-with-cancer-a-broken-covenant-with-patients/) of patients and the public. 

This workshop:

* Describes the current state of clinical trial transparency in the US, including relevant policies

* Outlines concrete steps for investigators and academic leaders to increase transparency in their research and at their institution

* Identifies opportunities for investigators to advocate for transparency through training and support from [ AllTrials USA](http://www.senseaboutscienceusa.org/alltrials/)

Workshop #2

Title: Clinical Trial Transparency Communication & Advocacy Train-the-Trainer Workshop

Length: 2.5 hours, 3 hours with Q&A

Overview: An interactive and practical workshop to build skills in communication and advocacy with a focus on clinical trial transparency issues. Advancing better research policies and practices at our institutions requires effective communication and strategic advocacy. This Train-the-Trainer Workshop will arm participants with the practice, resources, and community of support they need to improve their skills and to similarly train their peers.

Participants in this workshop:

1. Become familiar with essential information and resources on clinical trial transparency issues

2. Create compelling and targeted messages, presentations, and workshops that engage your audience

3. Plan effective communication and advocacy strategies
